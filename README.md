simulation - team 12
====

This project implements a cellular automata simulator. Currently, the following simulation types are supported: Conways' Game of Life, Fire Spreading, Percolation, Segregation, Predator Prey, Rock Paper Scissors, and Ant Foraging. The simulations support different cell shapes, different numbers of neighbors, and the option to run a torodial simulation.

#### Additional Sources: 
 - Duke University CS308 Labs, CS308 Lectures, CS308 TAs, and the CS308 Course Website (https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring20/compsci308/) were regularly consulted throughout the project.
 - The JavaFX API Documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/) and Java documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/) were used for most functionality questions.
 - Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) was used to find fixes for other minor issues we came across.
 
### Running the Program
####Main class: 
Run the SimulationMenu.java class to launch the program. Load in an XML configuration file and select your desired presets on the on screen menu. The simulation will open in a new window. Multiple simulations can be run simultaneously. 

Data files needed: files needed are the xml specification files that are in data folder. SET THE DATA FOLDER AS RESOURCES ROOT. These include: *fire_test.xml*, *life_test.xml*, *percolation_test.xml*, *segregation_test.xml*, *wator_test.xml*, *rps_test.xml*, *ant_test.xml* 

Features implemented: basic implementation
