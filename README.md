### Running the Program

Main class: run the simulationrunner.java class and follow prompt on screen to load and start simulations

Data files needed: files needed are the xml specification files that are in data folder. SET THE DATA FOLDER AS RESOURCES ROOT. these include fire_test.xml, life_test.xml, percolation_test.xml, segregation_test.xml, and wator_test.xml.

Features implemented: basic implementation
