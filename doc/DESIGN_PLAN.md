## Introduction
This program will implement a closed framework that runs and animates various 2D Cellular Automata
simulations (namely: the game of life, percolation, segregation, predator-prey, and fire simulations to start). 
We aim to design a program that can be easily extended to support many other CA simulations. The simulation
will be open for extension in that new cell objects can be created to accommodate the rules and needs of
CAs outside of those described above through easy use of formatted XML documents. Otherwise, the core functionality (the animation module, UI, and 
simulation runner) will be closed for modification.
